Here is the next instalment of "Mac's don't get viruses (oops... not really!)" This is Part 2/3: Don't install apps outside of the Apple "App Store."

These tips also applies Linux and other Unix systems with their "repositories"--even Windows is largely moving in this direction--there is an official "Windows Apps" store now [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/windows?icid=CNavAppsWindowsApps], which is growing quickly, while programs like Microsoft Office have moved largely to online versions.

This tip will prevent you from getting almost 100% of any type of malware [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17623422], including viruses, or even the new-fangled "ransomware"[https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/0307/KeRanger-ransomware-What-Mac-users-need-to-know] which I'm sure many of you have heard about lately. The tip is as simple as this: do not click any warnings that pop-up on your computer that something "is not signed," [https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/macstore_dialog.png] and never change the settings under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, lower than the middle setting, as shown in this image [http://i.i.cbsi.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/02/16/GateKeeperSettings.png].   Leave this at the top setting if possible, and only if needed for work-related programs like Adobe or Avid products, select the middle/2nd setting. Never use the 3rd choice.

All of your company's computers are hopefully already setup this way. To make this change on your personal computer, it is super easy, and if I ever find a great Youtube video for this, or create one myself for you, I'll link it here!
