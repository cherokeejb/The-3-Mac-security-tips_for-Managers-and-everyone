Today I'm starting a 3-part series of computer tips, called "Mac's don't get viruses (oops... not really!)" This is *Part 1: Use a regular user account.*

These tips also apply to Microsoft Windows and Linux/Unix. If you follow these tips, it will make your computer run more quickly and much more safely, and keep you in line with your IT Policy as well as policies of other organizations you may visit.

If you operate your computer as a normal user, (you may hear this referred to also a a non-privileged user, non-admin user, or similar), you will literally reduce your chance of most types of security-related problems with your computer, by over 80%. I've seen reports that put this even as high as 95%! The smartest IT minds in the world agree with this tip: here is a very easy-to-read report from the ASD [https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/essential-eight-explained.htm], and if you want to go down the security rabbit hole, see also these older reports from the UK's NCSC, and America's NSA [http://www.nsa.gov/ia/_files/factsheets/macosx_10_6_hardeningtips.pdf].

All of your company's computers are hopefully already setup this way. To make this change on your personal computer, it is super easy, and if I ever find a great Youtube video for this, or create onemyself for you, I'll link it here!

Feel free to grab a tea with me and have a nerdy chat, or share with me your favorite new music and films, at any time.
