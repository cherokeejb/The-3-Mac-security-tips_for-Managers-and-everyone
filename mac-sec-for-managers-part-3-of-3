Here's the last edition of our 3-part-series of tips to make your computer run better for you, and protect yourself online.  These days, tips like this are not even optional-- they'll probably keep you in line with your IT Policy at work and other companies--and even more importantly protect your personal relationships, your creative assets such as your music or film files, and as you'll see today, even your money!

This tip is called "Mac's don't get viruses  (oops... not really!):  Part 3 - DO NOT USE PASSWORDS FOR MORE THAN ONE THING!"

Does that title look like screaming ;-)  ...it is.  Friendly screaming, albeit.

*Q:*  How can I fix this problem?   *A:*  Don't use the same password for anything important.  That's it.  

In a recent interview I did on the Brakeing Down Security Podcast (sic) [http://brakeingsecurity.com/2017-039-creating-custom-training-for-your-org-and-audio-from-sans-berlin] several of the top Security professionals in Europe, which I interviewed that day, agreed that ironically password reuse was the biggest problem facing organizations today, because of how it may lead to so many other risks.  One person even suggested to do away with passwords completely in favor of something new.

If you want to hear some of the worst IT-scare-stories I've ever seen, read this about locking people out of there Apple stuff [https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vSD89TLJBAUJ:https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2016/03/an-icloud-scam-that-may-be-worse-than-ransomware/], or this about losing your life savings [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/11605010/Fraudsters-hacked-emails-to-my-solicitor-and-stole-340000-from-my-property-sale.html] while buying a house.  These are most simply the result of... yup, password reuse [https://xkcd.com/792/].

You don't have to take my word for it: take a look at online databases [https://haveibeenpwned.com/] of leaked passwords [https://hacked-emails.com/], and search for an old e-mail address, or a friend's e-mail address (*for security, please don't use your own, current e-mail addresses). 

If you have trouble making up good passwords, then use a software password manager, like LastPass [https://www.lastpass.com/] or KeePass [https://keepass.info/].  As well if you store anything really valuable to you or your company, online, then use an un-related 2nd factor [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication] for logging in.  Better yet don't store private or important things online at all!  Feel free to come to me with questions like this, at any time.

This concludes my series of how to easily secure your Mac.  Like I mentioned in the Introduction, if you combine these 3 tips with regular updates of your computer and applications and prudent web-browsing (think especially of blocking un-needed ads or other javascript) it will make your Mac safe against almost anything that would come it's way.  Thanks for reading, and contact me with any comments or questions  !
